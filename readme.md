# Tony Spoto Dot Com

## Description

This is my personal website built using HubL and HubSpot's CLI tools. The website features a custom "Coming Soon" page built with a custom module and template. It also includes a CSS loader animation for the splash page, which uses the methods described in [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/css3-progress-bars/).

The website is continually being modified and expanded, with potential future additions such as a blog or store.
